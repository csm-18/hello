hello is a one function toy programming language.

## Status
 1. Cli handling(compiler commands). \
 2. Compiler reads source file. \
 3. Lexer recognizes tokens.


## About
A small language with just one function to print strings onto the screen.

## Language And Features
1. Compiler accepts one source file(at a time).
2. Comments:
  `# Python like single-line comments`

 `ES6 like backtick string literals.`
  ```
4. print function:
  - print() function is just like c's puts() function.

  - We can call it as many times as we want.
5. Statements end with newline character like in python.
